# Goose Almanac

A functional, dynamic almanac for aggregating data and statistics about the band
**Goose** — inspired *in spirit* by [dmbalmanac.com](https://dmbalmanac.com), built on
the modern live-performance record maintained at [elgoose.net](https://elgoose.net).

> Non-commercial fan project. Live-performance data is sourced from the community
> database at elgoose.net, which is cached locally and attributed prominently.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Feature | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **0** | **Data Foundation** — sync elgoose → our own database, verified | 🔨 in progress |
| 1 | Show Browsing & Discovery — browse shows by year/tour/venue/map, rich setlist pages, "On This Day", upcoming shows | planned |
| 2 | Song Stats & History — per-song pages, gaps/bustouts, debuts, Spotify discography | planned |
| 3 | Jam & Set-Flow Analytics — jam charts, segue networks, era-aware analysis | planned |
| 4 | Personal Fan Tracking — "shows I've seen", personal stats, song life-list | planned |

Each phase has its own design spec under [`docs/superpowers/specs/`](docs/superpowers/specs/).

## Tech

- **Next.js + TypeScript** — the web app and shared data layer
- **PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM** — our cached copy of the live-performance record
- **Vitest** — test-first development

## Data sources

See [`docs/research/2026-06-26-data-landscape.md`](docs/research/2026-06-26-data-landscape.md)
