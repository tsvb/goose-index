# Deployment

The Goose Almanac runs as a **Next.js app on [Vercel](https://vercel.com)** reading from a
**managed Postgres database on [Neon](https://neon.tech)**. Both have free tiers that are
ample for a low-traffic fan site. Total cost to launch: **$0** (a custom domain, optional,
is ~$12/yr).

```
 elgoose.net ──(nightly GitHub Action: npm run sync)──▶  Neon Postgres  ◀──(reads)──  Vercel (Next.js)  ──▶  visitors
```

The web app only ever **reads** from the database at request time. All **writes** happen out
of band via the sync job, so page loads stay fast and never depend on the elgoose API being up.

## Connection details that matter

- **Neon gives you two connection strings.** Use the **pooled** one (host contains
  `-pooler`) for the app's `DATABASE_URL` — it routes through PgBouncer, which is what
  serverless needs. `db/client.ts` already sets `prepare: false`, required for PgBouncer's
  transaction pooling.
- The **direct** (non-pooled) string is only needed if a tool complains about pooling;
  migrations and sync work fine over the pooled string too.
- Neon free-tier databases **auto-suspend when idle**, so the first request after a quiet
  spell has a ~1s cold start. Fine for this site.

## One-time setup

### 1. GitHub repo — ✅ done

Public repo at `https://github.com/tsvb/goose-almanac`, `main` pushed.

### 2. Create the Neon database

1. Sign in at [neon.tech](https://neon.tech) (GitHub login is easiest).
2. **Create a project** (e.g. `goose-almanac`, region close to you).
3. Open **Connection Details** and copy the **pooled** connection string. It looks like:
   ```
   postgres://USER:PASSWORD@ep-xxxx-pooler.REGION.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
   ```
   Hand this to Claude (or keep it handy) — it's used in steps 3, 4, and 5.

### 3. Migrate the schema and load the data into Neon

Run locally, pointing the scripts at Neon instead of local Postgres:

```bash
DATABASE_URL='<neon-pooled-url>' npm run db:migrate   # create the tables
DATABASE_URL='<neon-pooled-url>' npm run sync          # pull elgoose → Neon
DATABASE_URL='<neon-pooled-url>' npm run verify        # expect: VERIFY OK
```

### 4. Create the Vercel project

1. Sign in at [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) with GitHub.
2. **Add New → Project**, import **`tsvb/goose-almanac`**. Framework auto-detects as Next.js.
3. Before the first deploy, add **Environment Variables**:
   | Name | Value |
   |------|-------|
   | `DATABASE_URL` | the **pooled** Neon string from step 2 |
   | `ELGOOSE_USER_AGENT` | _(optional)_ `GooseAlmanac/1.0 (+https://github.com/tsvb/goose-almanac)` |
4. **Deploy.** It goes live at `https://goose-almanac.vercel.app` (or similar).

### 5. Nightly data refresh (GitHub Action)

A scheduled workflow (`.github/workflows/sync.yml`) re-runs `npm run sync` + `npm run verify`
against the database every day so the live site stays current without any server staying up.
It reads the connection string from a repo secret — set to the **unpooled** (direct) Neon
string, since a bulk job is happiest off PgBouncer:

```bash
gh secret set DATABASE_URL --repo tsvb/goose-almanac --body '<neon-UNPOOLED-url>'
```

The workflow also has a **Run workflow** button (manual trigger) on the repo's Actions tab.

### 6. Custom domain (optional, later)

In Vercel: **Project → Settings → Domains → Add**, enter the domain, and follow Vercel's DNS
instructions at your registrar (an `A`/`CNAME` record, or nameserver delegation). HTTPS is
automatic.

## Redeploying / updating the site

- **Code changes:** push to `main` → Vercel auto-deploys.
- **Data only:** the nightly Action handles it; to refresh immediately, click **Run workflow**
  on the Actions tab (or re-run step 3 locally).
